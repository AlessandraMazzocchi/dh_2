<h1>Week 4 - Debrief</h1>
<h2>Tech portion</h2>
<br/>
<p>This week assignment was particularly interesting. Even though I wasn't able to put up the html page, I had the chance 
and was able to put up a server to host a webpage. It was slightly complicated because I lack in programming skills but
a classmates helped me with the programming portion. Unluckily the following part - put up the HTML page - was the obstacle
I am still trying to overcome. However, HTML feels less unfamiliar after this assignment; thanks to W3school and an HTML
cheat sheet website, I feel more comfortable with that specific markup language.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Reading portion</h2>
<br/>
<p>In my opinion, the best user-friendly interface is the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia of Human computer interaction</a>. 
It is clear, intuitive and leave very little doubts on what is in it and how to use it. Probably the web developer had a 
clear idea of the users that would have stumbled upon the page, therefore they developed the clearest website they could think
ok. The same thing can't be said for the <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio?ii=0&p=0&from=2020-01-27T19%3A08%3A18.5239131Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rijksmuseum</a>
and <a href="http://invisibleaustralians.org/faces/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Real face of white australia</a>; as a 
personal taste, the interface does not look user-friendly. It does not show a search tab or metadata to describe the items
diplayed on the webpage. In fact, unlike the Encyclopedia site, the two mentioned above require the user to actively scroll
to find the desired item.</p>
